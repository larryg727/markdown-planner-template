# Weekly markdown planner
To see a template of the weekly markdown you can look in the sample week directory

In addition to the weekly overview page for goals and appointments, each day of the week will include its own file with a todo list and note section.

## Instructions
To create a new template for the start of the week run the new week set up script with the following command
```shell
sh new_week.sh
```
The script will then ask you what day you would like to start the week on. If its starting today just push enter and it will create the template
